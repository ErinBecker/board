I'm emailing to ask if any of you have an hour of time to volunteer for
Software/Data Carpentry this or next week.  Our weekly discussion
sessions are full of new trainees and we'd love to get
a few more recently trained or experienced instructors on the calls to
talk about their experience.  I'm asking you all specifically because I
saw you during instructor training and/or during recent calls and I
think you'd be a great addition.  :)

If you are available during any of the upcoming calls (tomorrow or next
Tuesday, see http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion for
exact times), let me know and I'll make sure to connect you with the
discussion host.

Thanks for your consideration!
