# Exercises and Solutions

1. We keep extra exercises at the bottom of each topic page.

2. We use Javascript to hide them by default.

3. We mark them clearly as "extra" when they're visible.

4. We will add solutions to existing exercises (also hidden by
   default).  Note: "solutions" is plural: a single exercise might
   have several solutions listed.

5. We will *require* new exercise submissions to include solutions.
