# The 2018 CarpentryCon Task Force
The mission of the 2018 task force is to organize and host a meeting to bringing together members of the global Carpentry community and people with similar interests.

## Purpose and Scope
- **Community Building:** bring together members of the Carpentry community, including instructors, partners, advocates, and staff, together with people sharing similar interests from around the globe. We will have a “come and learn” format that is different from most conferences.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** The event will include sessions on teaching methods, curriculum development, community organization, and leadership skills. (As noted in the preamble, the final list of sessions will be determined by the program committee in consultation with the community, balancing “who wants to learn what?” with “who’s willing to teach what?”.)
- **Networking:** Opportunities will be provided for participants to come together informally to share stories about challenges and successes.
- **Contributed talks/posters:** There will be at least one session where attendees can share how they have incorporated Carpentry techniques into their own research and teaching, and/or how they have grown their local Carpentry community. This is crucial as presenting will be a requirement if attendees are seeking travel support from their home institution.

## What members of the task force do
Right now, we are working on
- drafting the CarpentryCon program
- recruiting local and global participants to help organize and promote the event
