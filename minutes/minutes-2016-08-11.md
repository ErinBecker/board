<h2>Motions</h2>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/1</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Steering Committee issues letter to Jonah Duckles asking him to work with Tracy Teal on exit strategy from NumFocus if we do not have adequate financial reporting in place by end of 2016.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: We don’t receive frequent updates on our finances.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/2</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Approve New Zealand eScience Infrastructure in-kind/paid partnership</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: They’re very keen to start conversations where we convince their partner organizations to become partners of ours on their own. They see themselves as catalyzing local capacity building with national coordination.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/3</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Approve University of Wisconsin in-kind partnership</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: This is an in-kind arrangement for us to have a large amount of Christina Koch’s time. She does more than the minimum amount of work we’re requiring in this agreement and her management is on-board with her continuing to be actively involved in our activities.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/4</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Approve University of Washington in-kind/paid partnership</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: The University of Washington eScience center is building one of our largest local instructor communities. Ariel Rokem is also taking initiative to help build more communities in his region at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Oregon State University, University of Oregon etc.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/5</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Approve North West University in-kind partnership</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: This agreement is based on Anelda's work advocating for Software Carpentry in South Africa. They will commit staff time at North West University to writing our bi-weekly summary and will commit to organizing at least 6 workshops for North West University in the next six-month. They're also supporting Anelda's time to advocate for and expand Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry around the African continent.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/6</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Allow Software Carpentry Executive Director to negotiate a non-standard Platinum partnership as a “Special Cooperative Agreement” with United States Department of Agriculture, which then be presented for approval to Steering Committee.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: The reason for this request is that the "Special Cooperative Agreement" is different with the others because we will have to book time from our staffs added on the agreement.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/7</h3>
<p>Presenter: Greg Wilson.</p>
<p>Text: That Software Carpentry accepts the in-kind donation of the time of a part-time system administrator.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: We’ve outgrown our current ad hoc arrangements, and our last system administrator volunteer is starting medical school in September.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/8</h3>
<p>Presenter: Kate Hertweck.</p>
<p>Text: Members of the steering committee are limited to 3 consecutive terms. Members participating in their second or third term are encouraged to serve as SC officers.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: This will avoid the possibility to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent Dictator For Life</a>.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/9</h3>
<p>Presenter: Kate Hertweck.</p>
<p>Text: Following an election, the new Steering Committee will meet jointly with the previous Steering Committee for no less than 60 days. During these joint meetings, the new SC will not have voting privileges. The SC is welcome to formally invite any previous SC members to meetings to assist in continuity and organization knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Resolution: Postponed.</p>
<p>Details: Steering Committee should not extend their vote right.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/10</h3>
<p>Presenter: Greg Wilson.</p>
<p>Text: Software Carpentry uses around US$600 of the R Consortium grant to cover travel and accommodation costs for Karin Lagesen to co-teach instructor training in Cambridge in September 2016.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-08-11/11</h3>
<p>Presenter: Greg Wilson.</p>
<p>Text: Software Carpentry, jointly with Data Carpentry, presents two Community Service awards annually to volunteer members identified by the Steering Committees as having made outstanding contributions.</p>
<p>Resolution: Postponed.</p>



<h2>Discussions</h2>

<h3>Discussion #2016-08-11/1</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jason Wiliams.</p>
<p>Text: Auxiliary Meetings</p>
<p>Resolution: Postponed</p>
<p>Details: To help finish up some outstanding activities, we propose that we may want to make use of the time in the off-meeting weeks to meet as needed to work on proposals and items. What would the topics be, who would be interested/available?</p>

<h3>Discussion #2016-08-11/2</h3>
<p>Presenter: Greg Wilson.</p>
<p>Text: Slideshows</p>
<p>Resolution: Postponed</p>
<p>Details: We are occasionally asked for slides or slideshows about the Carpentries. The https://github.com/swcarpentry/slideshows repository has some, but they are all badly out of date. Do we delete (since nobody cared enough to keep them up to date), ask for community maintainers (i.e., treat them like lessons), or something else?</p>
<p>Note: we also have:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/swcarpentry/sysadmin</li>
<li>https://github.com/swcarpentry/admin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion #2016-08-11/3</h3>
<p>Presenter: Greg Wilson.</p>
<p>Text: Archiving Old Workshop Repositories</p>
<p>Resolution: Postponed</p>
<p>Details: Many of the repositories owned by swcarpentry are for old workshops. Do we leave as they are (ever-growing pile), create a new organization called swcarpentry-archive and move them there (updating URLs in AMY as required), delete them entirely, or something else?</p>
